### FlickPick

### Pitch

Have you ever been sitting on the couch with a significant other or group of friends unable to pick what to watch? With FlickPick put the choice in the palm of your hand. Simply select your streaming services, join a party, and swipe!

### End User

The indecisive viewer. Everybody that has ever been unable to figure out what to watch.

### Problem

It can be very difficult to decide what to watch with a group of people. Everybody has different preferences and might not want to speak up about what they actually prefer. With FlickPick you can easily find something that everybody wants to watch without having to scroll endlessly.

### Equity Anaylsis   
* While this application is designed to bring people together and be inclusive of all, it does take make some baseline assumptions for use. It assumes the user's access to one or many streaming services, as well as the user's access to the hardware necessary to use those services and the application.
* Given more time, I would design this product with accessiblity features to both increase font size and add text-to-speech capability for the visually impaired. I would also add capability to filter results by closed-captioning availability for the hearing impaired

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
  * TMDB for movie details
  * ReelGood for most popular (stretch goal)
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use? How will you use OAuth to do something on the user's behalf?
  * Google OAuth to create an account with the users details
